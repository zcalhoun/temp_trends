# Temp Trends
This repository contains code for analyzing temperature trends.

The notebooks contain an example of how to pull data, and some VERY simple analysis.

Note: this repo assumes no data is saved within the repository. Please save your data
in a `/data` directory so you don't accidentally push this code to GitHub.
